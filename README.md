<h2>Objective</h2>
Evaluate STEMSPARK.id's performance over 2024 by analysing student growth, learning program effectiveness, teacher contribution, class popularity, and class category distribution to identify the success of education transformation through technology as well as future strategic development opportunities.

<h2>Analytics Questions</h2>
Before we begin, let's first recognise some of the business questions we want to get from the data:

1. How will student numbers grow during 2024?
2. Is the workload among teachers evenly distributed?
3. Are there teachers who need additional support?
4. What is the proportion of class category distribution during 2024?
5. Top 5 classes with the most students
   
<h2>Analysis Results</h2>

1. The number of active students increased from 75 students in January to 112 students in December, with a sharp decline in April and August due to the end of mentoring activities for the NASEF Minecraft Competition and the Indonesian Scratch Competition. The high increase is usually due to mentoring activities for competitions.
2. The distribution of workload between teachers is still unbalanced. In the extracurricular category, Andrian manages a fairly large number of classes, while Rifky and Yura mostly handle online classes.
3. Given the higher number of students in the extracurricular category compared to online classes, Andrian's workload is quite heavy. Therefore, Andrian needs additional support so that the learning process can run optimally.
4. Extracurricular classes get the highest proportion of 63.82% compared to other classes. Meanwhile, offline classes get the lowest proportion of 1.16%.
5. The top order consisted of SD Labschool UPI in first place, Python Class in second, SMP Labschool UPI in third, SDI Abu Seno in fourth, and SMP Hikmah Teladan in fifth. The top five is dominated by extracurricular classes as they have more students than other classes.
