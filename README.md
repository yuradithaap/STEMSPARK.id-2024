<h2>Objective</h2>
Evaluate STEMSPARK.id's performance over 2024 by analysing student growth, learning program effectiveness, teacher contribution, class popularity, and class category distribution to identify the success of education transformation through technology as well as future strategic development opportunities.

<h2>Analytics Questions</h2>
Before we begin, let's first recognise some of the business questions we want to get from the data:

1. How will student numbers grow during 2024?
2. Is the workload among teachers evenly distributed?
3. Are there teachers who need additional support?
4. What is the proportion of class category distribution during 2024?
5. Top 5 classes with the most students
   
<h2>Analysis Results</h2>

1. The number of active students increased from 75 students in January to 112 students in December, with a sharp decline in April and August due to the end of mentoring activities for the NASEF Minecraft Competition and the Indonesian Scratch Competition. The high increase is usually due to mentoring activities for competitions.
2. The distribution of workload between teachers is still unbalanced. In the extracurricular category, Andrian manages a fairly large number of classes, while Rifky and Yura mostly handle online classes.
3. Given the higher number of students in the extracurricular category compared to online classes, Andrian's workload is quite heavy. Therefore, Andrian needs additional support so that the learning process can run optimally.
4. Extracurricular classes get the highest proportion of 63.82% compared to other classes. Meanwhile, offline classes get the lowest proportion of 1.16%.
5. The top order consisted of SD Labschool UPI in first place, Python Class in second, SMP Labschool UPI in third, SDI Abu Seno in fourth, and SMP Hikmah Teladan in fifth. The top five is dominated by extracurricular classes as they have more students than other classes.

<h2>Recommendation</h2>

1. Given the increasing number of students influenced by mentoring for competitions, it is advisable to regularly hold or participate in competitions. This can attract more students to join and it is better to work with the school to socialize the competition to attract many participants.
2. The distribution of classes between needs to be rearranged. Rifky and Yura can be given more responsibility in handling extracurricular classes to ease Andrian's burden. Sandra and Lia can be given more responsibility in handling online classes so that the online class schedule is more balanced.
3. To reduce Andrian's workload, it is recommended to add teachers in each extracurricular class. This can help Andrian maintain performance while ensuring the quality of learning remains optimal.
4. Offline classes have a very low proportion of students (1.16%). It is recommended to increase offline class promotions, such as through free trial classes, collaboration with schools, or attractive learning package offers.
5. It is recommended to expand the reach to other schools in offering extracurricular programs, considering that extracurriculars have the highest proportion of participants compared to other types of classes.
